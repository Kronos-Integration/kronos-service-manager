rename Flow actions:

- declareFlows -> registerFlows (registered)
- initializeFlow -> prepareFlow (prepared)
- intializeFlow -> startFlow    (running)
- pauseFlow                     (paused)
- stopFlow                      (terminated)
- deleteFlow


Flow:


/**
 * Brings a flow into the running state
 * Returns promise that fullfills with the flow in the running state
 */
start()

/**
 * Brings the flow into the terminated state
 * Returns a promise that fullfills with the flow in the terminated state
 */
stop()

/**
 * Brings the flow into the paused state
 * Returns a promise that fullfills with the flow in the paused state
 */
pause()
